**WARNING: Very early stage and used only for my own purposes, the goal is to provide an easy-to-use api to the python package [mercadopago](https://github.com/mercadopago/sdk-python).**


## Installation

You can install the development version of mercadopago from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
